REACHABILITY ISSUES - MOST CRITICAL:\n     - Some agents CANNOT reach their goals\n     - Check that all rooms/areas are connected with doorways\n     - Doorways must be at least 1.0m wide\n     - Verify walls don't completely block paths\n     - Each agent needs a continuous path from start to goal\n     - Don't place goals behind walls with no openings\n\n\nORIGINAL REQUEST:\nCreate an office suite with 3 connected rooms:\n- Room 1 (lobby): x=[0,5], y=[0,5], door on right wall at y=2.5, width 1.2m\n- Room 2 (hallway): x=[5,12], y=[0,5], connects rooms 1 and 3\n- Room 3 (conference): x=[5,12], y=[5,10], door on bottom wall at x=8.5, width 1.5m\n- Walls fully enclose each room except for doorways\nRobot starts in room 1 at (2,2), goal in room 3 at (8,7)\nHuman 1 in room 3 at (9,7), going to room 1 at (2,3)\nHuman 2 in hallway at (8,2), going to room 3 at (10,7)\nHuman 3 in room 1 at (3,4), goal in hallway at (9,2)\nThis creates doorway congestion and multi-room navigation\n\nNOW REGENERATE THE SCENARIO:\n- Fix ALL the problems listed above\n- Pay special attention to reachability - ensure EVERY agent can reach their goal\n- If creating rooms, explicitly define doorway openings with precise coordinates\n- Double-check that wall segments connect properly\n- Verify agent positions are in valid free space\n\nGenerate the corrected JSON now.\n",
